# arduino WS2812B LED Example

This little project was create to animate make my 3dprint "THE RING" from https://makerworld.com/en/models/533264

Electrical setup is very simple, you need:
 - arduino ( any type ) with 1 digital PIN.
 - Power source - you need one since these LEDS are power hungry. I used: In full power they use up to 60ma, so 39 LEDS ( in my case ) can use up to 2.3 Amps
